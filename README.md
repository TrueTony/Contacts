# Contacts
Stidy project representing the implementation of phone Book
## Using
Running without argument - can add, edit and remove an entry from the book
Running with an argument - the first argument is the name of the file in which the program will perform serialization/deserialization
## Features
- Base classes inherit from the abstract "Contact" class
- Functions work with the abstract class, thereby implementing polymorphism
- If there is an argument, when creating, changing, deleting an entry, the phone book is serialized
